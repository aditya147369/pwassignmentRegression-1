    "\n",
    "3] Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Simple Linear Regression: Easier to interpret and visualize since it involves only one predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Multiple Linear Regression: More complex as it involves multiple predictors, requiring more advanced techniques for interpretation and visualization (e.g., partial regression plots).\n",

    "4] Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Both models: Assume linearity, independence, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Multiple Linear Regression: Additionally assumes that there is no multicollinearity (independent variables are not highly correlated with each other).\n",

    "5] Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Simple Linear Regression: Used when the relationship between the dependent variable and one independent variable is of interest.\n",

    "b. Multiple Linear Regression: Used when the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables is of interest, allowing for the assessment of the impact of several predictors simultaneously.\n",

    "6] Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Simple Linear Regression Example: Predicting exam scores based solely on study time. If you have data showing how much each student studied and their resulting exam scores, you can use simple linear regression to see how exam scores change with study time alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Multiple Linear Regression Example: Predicting exam scores based on study time, sleep hours, and previous exam scores. Here, you use multiple linear regression to understand how these variables collectively affect exam performance. Each independent variable (study time, sleep hours, previous scores) would have its own coefficient, showing its individual impact on the exam score when the others are held constant."

    "Ans - Multicollinearity occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables (predictors) in a model are highly correlated with each other. In other words, they provide redundant information about the dependent variable (the outcome you're trying to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we use multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Unreliable Coefficient Estimates: The estimated coefficients (the weights associated with each predictor) become unstable and unreliable. Small changes in the data can lead to large swings in the coefficient values, making it difficult to interpret the true impact of each predictor on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Reduced Statistical Significance: Multicollinearity can make it harder to identify which predictors are truly important. The standard errors of the coefficients tend to inflate, leading to wider confidence intervals and potentially masking the statistical significance of some predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Correlation Matrix: Examine the correlation matrix of your predictors. High correlations (close to 1 or -1) between pairs of predictors are a red flag for potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): VIF quantifies how much the variance of an estimated coefficient is increased due to multicollinearity. A VIF of 1 means no multicollinearity, while VIF values above 5 or 10 (depending on the context) suggest problematic multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Tolerance: Tolerance is the inverse of VIF (1/VIF). Low tolerance values (close to 0) also indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing teh issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Regularization Techniques: Techniques like Ridge regression and Lasso regression can help mitigate the effects of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictors towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can create new, uncorrelated variables from your original predictors. However, this can make the interpretation of the model more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Collect More Data: Sometimes, multicollinearity is due to having a limited sample size. Collecting more data can help reduce the correlation between predictors and improve the model's stability."
